		<paragraph>
            This is a test paragraph. It contains several sentences.
            Some sentences are similar to each other. Similar sentences should be grouped together.
            This paragraph demonstrates how the similarity service works.

		<paragraph>
            This test paragraph has sentences. Sentences that are similar should be placed in groups.
            Completely different sentences like this one should be separate.
            The similarity algorithm works by calculating cosine similarity between sentence embeddings.

		<paragraph>
            This is another test paragraph. It also contains several sentences.
            Sentences in this paragraph might be similar to those in other paragraphs.
            The application processes XML documents and extracts all text content.
            Extracted text is split into sentences using a simple pattern.

            The similarity service performs several steps. First, it extracts sentences from XML.
            Then, each sentence is converted to a vector embedding.
            Similar sentences are grouped based on a configurable similarity threshold.
            Results are stored in-memory and associated with a session ID.

            XML processing works by recursively traversing the document tree.
            Text nodes are extracted and combined into a single string.
            The string is then split into individual sentences.
            Each sentence is processed independently.
